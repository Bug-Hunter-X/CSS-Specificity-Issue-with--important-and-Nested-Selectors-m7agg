The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the `!important` declaration in `.child` overrides the `color: blue` from `.parent` but it is overridden by `.parent .child`. This behavior is unexpected because it seems like the most specific selector should always win, but in reality the order of declaration may play a major role.
