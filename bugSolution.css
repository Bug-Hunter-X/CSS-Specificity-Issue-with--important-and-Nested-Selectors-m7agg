The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and using a more appropriate approach to styling. Instead of relying on `!important`, we should leverage more specific selectors and a proper structure.

Here's a corrected version of the CSS:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green !important; /*only if this style is absolutely necessary*/
}
```

By removing the unnecessary `!important` from `.child`, we ensure that the nested selector `.parent .child` can override it when needed with a higher specificity. The `!important` should be used only sparingly and when strictly necessary.
